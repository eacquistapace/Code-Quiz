# Code-Quiz

**Main Objective**
User is given a quiz- in this case, a quiz about anime characters.
When the user clicks the 'START GAME!' button, the quiz will initiate questions and a timer.
After the user answers one question, they will be told whether their answer was correct or incorrect, and they will move onto another question.
Time is reduced on the timer everytime the user answers a question incorrectly.
Once the user is out of time, the quiz will end and the user will be able to log their score with their initials on a high scores list.

**Additional Information Regarding Project**
This project was a really great way to get more familiar with javascript and web-API's. I wish that I had a little more time to customize the page with additional css though, it's a bit of an eye-sore. Unfortunately my js is not working perfectly either, specifically I was not able to figure out the function to identify whether or not the user had gotten the question correct. It will always say that the user is incorrect, even if they answer correctly. I hope to put a little more research into why this is happening to make sure the code works properly for the user. I also would have liked to add more characters to my array to make the quiz a bit more exciting!
